# algorithms

Random algorithms from my CS master studies

# arrayNeighborDiff

Finds the biggest difference between to sorted elements of a unsorted array in O(n)

# trianglesInGraph

Finds loops of length 3 in a given graphs adjacency list in O(n\*m)

# sortLinkedList

Sorts a linked list by recursivly traversing it using element pointers in O(n)
