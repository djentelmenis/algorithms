# algorithms

Random algorithms from my CS master studies

# arrayNeighborDiff

Finds the biggest difference between to sorted elements of a unsorted array in O(n)

# trianglesInGraph

Finds loops of length 3 in a given graphs adjacency list in O(n\*m)

# printSortedLinkedList

Prints a sorted linked list by recursivly traversing it using element pointers in O(n)

# LIS2Params

Finds a longest increasing subsequence in a sequence of objects with two values in O(n log n)

# longestSubsetLength

Finds the length of a loongest possible subset in a set of numbers in O(n^2)

# intersectingCircles

Finds the number of circle intersections from a list of circles and their coordinates in O(n^2 log(n))

# indEdgeSet

Finds the maximum number of independent edges (don't share a vertice) in a tree graph in O(n)
